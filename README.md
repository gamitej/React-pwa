### Progressive Weather Web-App In React


## Quick Look at PWA

- PWA stands for a progressive web app, and it is the technology that brings web and mobile development to a new level. It is designed to bring the best user experience for the mobile users of web apps and platforms. The PWA technology allows the user to open a native-like app via a browser, to install it instantly, to make use of most native-like functions, and to use the app offline. The goal of a progressive web app developer is to make a website resemble an app installed on oneâ€™s smartphone, tablet, laptop, or PC.
